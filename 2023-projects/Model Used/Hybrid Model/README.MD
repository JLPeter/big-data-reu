# **Hybrid Model Approaches**
## Dense+LSTM_With_NewPreprocessing.ipynb
-standardizes the features and scales the target variable
-uses Dense and LSTM layers to predict ice bed topography
-KNN MAG data used with the training
-Evaluates the model using RMSE, MAE, R^2
-Visualizes predictions as a 2D plot

## LSTM+Dense layer based Model

The LSTM+Dense based model is trained with the same dataset as Dense based model.RMSE, MAE, R^2 metrics are also used here to evaluate the model.The model creates a prediction with the 1201x1201 dataset and a visualization is produced and saved as an h5 file.
