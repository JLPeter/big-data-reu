Abstract: 
The purpose of this research project is to investigate current advances in predicting topography in Greenland using ice-penetrating radar data and machine-learning techniques. Accurate representations of bed topography are vital for understanding ice sheet stability and vulnerability to climate change, especially in relation to rising sea levels. To achieve this, we explored three interpolation preprocessing methods (Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, and Kriging) alongside various machine learning models including Dense Neural Network, LSTM, VAE, XGBoost, Gaussian Process Regression, and Kriging-based Residual Learning. Among the evaluated models, the XGBoost model with nearest neighbor interpolated data exhibited exceptional performance with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 32.680, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.273, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.967. We also compared our prediction with a popular Greenland ice bed topography data product called BedMachine using the above metrics and Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI). The promising results from our research show machine learning models could be used to accurately predict Greenland's ice-bed topography, and provide valuable insights into ice sheet stability and climate change impacts on rising sea levels.
