**Abstract:** Accurate quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is essential for creating hydrological models, managing water resources, addressing flood risk, and more. Traditional methods of ob taining precipitation data from rain gauges and radar have limitations such as sparse coverage and inaccurate estimates for different precipitation types and intensities. Symbolic regression, a machine learning method that generates mathematical equations fitting the data, presents a unique approach to estimating precipitation that is both interpretable and functional. To estimate precipitation from WSR-88D dual-polarimetric radar data from Oklahoma and Florida over four dates, we tested symbolic regression methods from genetic programming to deep learning, cluster-augmented symbolic regression, and custom loss functions. We found that symbolic regression is both accurate in estimating rainfall and interpretable through learned equations. Our research provides insights into improving the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation
through interpretable and efficient symbolic regression methods.
